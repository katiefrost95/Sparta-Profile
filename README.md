# Sparta-Profile

## Brief

Create a portfolio of yourself using bootstrap and making it responsive. Include certain sections such as about me, experience and contact page. 

### This is my portfolio which is split into 4 sections:
1. The header Image.
2. About me Section.
3. Experience.
4. Contact/footer.

### What I found hard
* The trickiest part for me was the responsive design and trying to change the paragraph widths and hide pictures etc.

### What I'm pleased with
* I'm most pleased with the layout of my page, the nav bar and how it links down to the relevant sections.
